### Hello World!

The customary introduction in computer programming is Hello World. Naturally, in the world of
micro controllers, it's _blink_. Make an LED flash. Yay-ness!

Well, yeah, that was fun. Let's try for something a _little_ more ambitious shall we?

I've seen pictures around of clocks that spell out the time in words.

That looks cool and really shouldn't be too hard to achieve as a starter project. So this project
is basically me delving into the world of PIC programming, and reminding myself which way round a
diode goes into a PCB.

## Is there really a need for an ICSP header?
While perusing the SparkFun tutorials, I happened across their [PogoBeds](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/138)
post, which basically explains how they test and prepare their wares.

They make use of a really interesting little wotsit called a "Pogo Pin", which is essentially a pin with a sprung end.
It dawned on me that I could create a cable to run from the PICkit 3 to a set of Pogo Pins on a small board, which is
then pressed onto the main board for programming. Saves needing to put an ICSP header, and I'd have needed to create
a lead from the PICkit anyway.

Seems like a possible plan, and if I make the ICSP contacts on the board as plated through holes then there's nothing to
stop me from soldering on a header later if it all goes awry.
